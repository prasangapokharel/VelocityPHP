# Uploads Directory

This directory stores user-uploaded files.

## Security Notes

1. Never allow direct PHP execution in this directory
2. Validate file types before upload
3. Rename uploaded files to prevent overwrites
4. Set proper permissions (755 or 644)
5. Consider moving to cloud storage for production

## .htaccess

Add this to prevent PHP execution:

```apache
<Files *.php>
    deny from all
</Files>
```
